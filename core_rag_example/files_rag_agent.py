# Artificial Intelligence Basics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## Types of AI:
1. **Narrow AI**: AI designed for specific tasks (like image recognition)
2. **General AI**: AI with human-level intelligence across all domains
3. **Super AI**: AI that surpasses human intelligence

## Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve 
from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Applications:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Healthcare Diagnostics

# Cloud Computing Guide

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet ("the cloud") 
to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## Service Models:
1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Virtual machines, storage, networks
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Development platforms and tools
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Complete applications over the internet

## Deployment Models:
- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet
- **Private Cloud**: Services maintained on a private network
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds

## Benefits:
- Cost reduction
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Automatic updates
- Disaster recovery
- Global accessibility

## Major Providers:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- IBM Cloud

# Cybersecurity Fundamentals

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs 
from digital attacks.

## Common Threats:
1. **Malware**: Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware
2. **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails to steal sensitive information
3. **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to divulge information
4. **DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelming systems with traffic
5. **Insider Threats**: Threats from within the organization

## Security Principles:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized users
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems are accessible when needed

## Best Practices:
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Keep software updated
- Regular security training
- Backup data regularly
- Network segmentation
- Incident response planning

## Security Tools:
- Firewalls
- Antivirus software
- Intrusion detection systems
- Security information and event management (SIEM)
- Vulnerability scanners
