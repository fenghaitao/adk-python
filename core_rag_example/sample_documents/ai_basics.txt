# Artificial Intelligence Basics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.

## Types of AI:
1. **Narrow AI**: AI designed for specific tasks (like image recognition)
2. **General AI**: AI with human-level intelligence across all domains
3. **Super AI**: AI that surpasses human intelligence

## Machine Learning:
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve 
from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error

## Applications:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Healthcare Diagnostics
