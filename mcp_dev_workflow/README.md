## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment support

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp_dev_workflow
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```bash
   # Ensure MCP servers are executable
   chmod +x mcp_*.py
   ```

3. **Permission Denied Errors:**
   ```bash
   # Check file permissions and allowed directories
   ls -la mcp_*.py
   ```

4. **Virtual Environment Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Recreate virtual environment
   rm -rf .venv
